# Starfold

**Starfold is the flight software for [Starkit](https://github.com/Mikuel210/Starkit).**

Starkit is an electric model rocket designed for propulsive landings. Starkit is designed to test guidance, navigation and control for one day landing a rocket flying on solid motors.

Starfold is the software that will make that possible.
